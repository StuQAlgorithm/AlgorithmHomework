 N-Queens

 The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard
 such that no two queens attack each other.Given an integer n,
 return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

For example,
There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle:

[
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
